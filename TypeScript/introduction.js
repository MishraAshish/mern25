// Type Script - derives its name from two words Type and Script
// Type - is a way to define the type of data   
// Script - is a way to write code in a scripting language

//let getName = ()=>{name = `Synergistic IT`};
let getName = `Synergistic IT`;

// issue we have with es6 and javascript is type safety
user.userName = getName(); //work // This line is incorrect as getName is not a function, it is a string.
